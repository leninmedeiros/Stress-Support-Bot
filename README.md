# Stress-Support-Bot
Telegram Bot for supporting people facing stress.

Using Python 3.5.2 or newer with telepot and MongoDB (with PyMongo).

You must have a file called '.config' in your local project folder.
Check config-example.txt to see how it looks like.

Feel free to be in touch and check my website (leninmedeiros.com) to see other stuff I have been working on.
